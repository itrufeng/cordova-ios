<h1>What's New in Scandit SDK 3.0.* for iOS</h1>

<p>The new Scandit SDK 3.0.* features a number of improvements to the overall scanning 
performance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>full screen scanning: In Scandit SDK 2.*, the user had to place the barcode in the
 center of the camera image. In this new release, barcodes are detected and decoded in
 the entire camera image.</p></li>
<li><p>improved autofocus management: We improved the camera control which means that the
 camera properties (such as focus) are maintained over successive barcode scans. This new
 feature makes a big difference if you are planning on scanning multiple barcodes in 
 sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>better scan performance and robustness: We further improved our blurry barcode decoding 
 algorithms so that even the very blurry images of an iPhone 5 (before the autofocus is 
 activated) are now decoded. </p></li>
<li><p>new cleaner scan screen interface with the option to add a button to switch cameras 
 (from the front to the back camera) </p></li>
<li><p>new symbologies: beta support for PDF417 and MSI Plessey. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>IMPORTANT: Scandit SDK 3.0.* requires a new iOS framework: libc++. To add the library, select your 
target in Xcode, choose build phases and add the library under the "Link Binary With Libraries" entry.</p></li>
<li><p>In 3.0, we only support iOS devices with iOS 5.0 and higher. If you need need iOS 4.3 support, 
using Scandit SDK 2.* for iOS. </p></li>
<li><p>In 3.0, we no longer support the iPhone 3G. If you need iPhone 3G support, we recommend 
using Scandit SDK 2.* for iOS. </p></li>
<li><p>Access to the methods that are available for scan screen customization has been 
restricted for users of our free Community edition. They remain available for our 
enterprise customers. Moving forward we want apps using our free community 
edition to have a common scan screen user interface that promotes our Scandit brand. </p></li>
<li><p>The Scandit SDK starts by default in full screen scanning mode. If you want to only scan barcodes 
in a restricted area of the camera image, you should call the "restrictActiveScanningArea" method of 
the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.4 (August 2nd, 2013) </h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue where rapid allocation and deallocation of ScanditSDKBarcodePicker could lead to app crash for 
some view controller configurations. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue in new full image barcode detection algorithm that could lead to rare app crashes when camera image 
featured particular repetitive texture. </p></li>
<li><p>Enabled camera switch for tablets in Scandit SDK demo app.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.3 (July 17th, 2013 - available as enterprise trial only)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue where camera image was slightly distorted on iPad devices. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where previously set1DEnabled would not enable MSIPlessey Decoder and set2DEnabled would 
not enable PDF417 decoder. </p></li>
<li><p>Software update to decode blurry barcodes that upside down in the camera image.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where barcode highlighting in camera image was slightly off on some iOS devices. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where orientation changes would freeze camera when the scanning area was restricted via the 
"restrictActiveScanningArea" method.</p></li>
<li><p>Software update to switch off the "StandBy" state introduced in 3.0.0. The Scandit SDK enters this 
StandBy state by default after a successful scan because it makes subsequent scanner starts 
significantly faster. This "StandBy" State requires additional resources (power, memory) though and 
can be disabled by calling disableStandbyState on the picker. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.2: </h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the memory management of the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker where the release of the 
picker object could interfere with the instantiation of a new picker object. This could have been 
the cause of problems with ARC in 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.  </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the reset of the viewfinder and the viewfinder animation was not 
working correctly. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in implementation of ScanditSDKNextFrameDelegate protocol that was not working 
since the 3.0.0 update. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.1:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Updated ScanditSDKRotatingBarcodePicker to also access iphone settings if ipad ones arent available when 
retrieving supportedInterfaceOrientations.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed duplicate header entry that caused warning message in Xcode.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where white viewfinder rectangle in the scan UI was jumping between different barcode locations 
when barcode is in vertical orientation. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where white viewfinder rectangle changed size when presented as navigation controller and the user 
changed orientation from portrait to landscape and back to portrait. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug which did not allow the picker to be locked into a non-portrait orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a method to maintain the torch state in between successful scans. The current default implementation
of stopScanning switches the torch off. The new method is called stopScanningAndKeepTorchState. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a small bug in the torch implementation. Previously, the user had to tap the icon twice after a previous "stop torch" command. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a viewfinder resizing issue when an iPhone is turned from portrait to landscape back to portrait. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the cancel button would not respond on iPads in landscape mode when the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker was presented modally.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues (will be fixed in one of the next releases):</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Barcodes that are placed at an angle of 45 degrees in the image are currently not detected reliably. </p></li>
<li><p>Highlighted code in the scan UI is slightly off the true position in landscape mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Scanning of vertical barcodes is not working as reliable as horizontal barcodes. </p></li>
<li><p>Barcode scanning performance with the iPad4 front facing camera is significantly worse 
than on the iPad3 front facing camera. </p></li>
<li><p>The PDF417 Scanner is still beta - the current version works well with PDF417 that have 
large modules - it struggles as the pdf417 features get smaller. </p></li>
</ul>
